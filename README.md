This script takes as input a directory containing .e57 files, a number of points to use for mean distance estimation, and a standard deviation multiplier threshold. It uses the CloudCompare executable located at a specific file path to process the .e57 files in the input directory.

The script creates a directory named 'processed' in the input directory to store the processed .e57 files. For each .e57 file in the input directory, the script runs the CloudCompare executable with certain parameters to apply the Statistical Outlier Removal (SOR) filter to the point cloud data. The processed point cloud data is then saved as an .e57 file in the 'processed' directory. The name of each processed file is in the format 'sorX.e57', where X is an integer starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 for each processed file.
